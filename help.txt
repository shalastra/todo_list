Simple RESTful server for handling basic HTTP operations,
serves as a tasks application.
Written in Python 2.7, it is not going to work with different
version due to deprecation some of standard libraries.
Program is using only standard libraries, no additional setup is
required.

To test, simple run:
curl -i http://localhost:8080/tasks

In response you will receive a list of tasks in JSON format

to test getting one element, run:
curl -i http://localhost:8080/task/<id>
In response you will receive a single task in JSON format

To add new task you should execute(instead of <id> put a number):
curl -X PUT -d '{"name": "Buy bananas"}' "http://localhost:8080/task/<id>"
This will create a new key/value pair.

Now you can call task/<id> and you will receive element you just added.

To remove an element call:
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/task/<id>"
Where <id> should be an id you want to remove.
